# Classification of Human Imagination:


### Project Description and Disclosure:

EEG reflects the coordinated activity of millions of neurons near a non-invasive scalp electrode.
Because these are scalp potentials, necessarily, they have relatively poor spatiotemporal resolution
compared to other neural recording techniques. EEG is believed to be recording dipoles that are
transmitted through the scalp.

This dataset is made publicly available through: http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/. However,
typically, people process these datasets with MATLAB. The data used in this project had We have formatted for the
class purposes as opposed to working with the raw .gdf files. This is why I did not upload the data 
as the instructor did not allow its distribution. If you want to access the data, you should visit the BCI competition site and download the raw gdf files after filling out the following agreement:

Each participant has to agree to give reference to the group(s) which recorded the data and to cite
(one of) the paper listed in the respective description in each of her/his publications where one of those
data sets is analyzed. Furthermore, we request each author to report any publication involving BCI
Competition data sets to us for including it in our list.

After filling out the form and pushing the ”I Agree” button an automatic e-mail will be generated
containing location and access information for the data set download area.
If you want to use this dataset for any research purposes, you should download the data from their website after filling out the
appropriate agreement.

For each subject, they record from 25 EEG electrodes while the user imagines performing one of four
actions. These four actions include motion of (I) left hand, (II) right hand, (III) both feet, and (IV) tongue. Therefore, this is a classification task (with four outcome classes), where the EEG is used as input to determine what action the subject was imagining.
