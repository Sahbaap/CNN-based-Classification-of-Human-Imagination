# Classification of Human Imagination:


### Project Description:

EEG reflects the coordinated activity of millions of neurons near a non-invasive scalp electrode.
Because these are scalp potentials, necessarily, they have relatively poor spatiotemporal resolution
compared to other neural recording techniques. EEG is believed to be recording dipoles that are
transmitted through the scalp.

This dataset is made publicly available through: http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/. However,
typically people process these datasets with MATLAB. We have formatted the data in a way that
it will be easily loadable for you, as opposed to working with the raw .gdf files. These datasets are
internal for this class and should not be distributed. If you would like to publish based off of this
data, you should visit the BCI competition site and download the raw gdf files after filling out the
following agreement:

Each participant has to agree to give reference to the group(s) which recorded the data and to cite
(one of) the paper listed in the respective description in each of her/his publications where one of those
data sets is analyzed. Furthermore, we request each author to report any publication involving BCI
Competiton data sets to us for including it in our list.

After filling out the form and pushing the ”I Agree” button an automatic e-mail will be generated
containing location and access information for the data set download area.
Again, we provide a processed version for teaching purposes, but if you want to use this dataset
for any research purposes, you should download the data from their website after filling out the
appropriate agreement.

For each subject, they record from 25 EEG electrodes while the user imagines performing one of four
actions. Therefore, this is a classification task (with four outcome classes), where the EEG is used
to determine what action the subject was imagining.
